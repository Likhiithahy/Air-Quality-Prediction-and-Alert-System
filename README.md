# Air Quality Prediction and Alert System 🌫️

## 🧠 Overview
A Flask-based web application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) from past data using a Random Forest Regressor model.  
It also provides real-time health alerts and safety advisories based on predicted AQI levels.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- HTML, CSS  
- OpenWeatherMap & IQAir APIs  

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts AQI values from historical data  
- Fetches live air quality data from APIs  
- Categorizes air quality (Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous)  
- Sends personalized health advisories via simulated email alerts  

## 🧩 Model
Trained using **RandomForestRegressor** and saved as `models/aqi_model.pkl`.
